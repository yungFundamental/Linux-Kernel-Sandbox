# Linux Kernel Playground

Basically a linux kernel development sandbox.
Pretty simple and homemade - have fun!

## Components
This was made with the official [linux kernel repository](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).

The root file system was created with the [Alpine](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/index.html) Rootfs for [x86_64](https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.22/releases/x86_64/alpine-minirootfs-3.22.1-x86_64.tar.gz).

This whole project runs using [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).
